# InteractiveAR

This project aims to create interaction with the user.
The first step is to show information to the user. So in the first step we make the information board to face whereever the user moves.

Note:

  * This is based on arcore-unity-sdk-v1.4.1.unitypackage.
  * You can reimport arcore-unity-sdk-v1.4.1.unitypackage to double check if anything is missing.
  * Make sure your device has ARCore installed on it(Link to ARCore Appp: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.ar.core&hl=en_IN)
